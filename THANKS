TrinityCore is a derivation/rewrite of Trinity, which was originally written
by Team Python and the WoW Daemon Team. Many people further helped Trinity Core
by submitting bug reports, code patches, and suggestions. Thanks to the
community!

Special thanks should go out to the WowNordrassil team. We have gained help from
them many times in the creation of this project. Keep up the good work guys.

Thanks to the Nordrassil team (http://nordrassil.cubava.cu) for scripts.
